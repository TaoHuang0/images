# Image

## Introduction

I create a series of base classes and decorator classes to collectively represent a digital image, like what you would see on Snapchat or Instagram.

In this context, the decorator pattern will be used to add visual modifications to a starting image. For example, one decorator class you will make adds a border around an existing image; another decorator superimposes a configurable circle somewhere on the image. The order in which you add the decorators to the base image will determine the order in which the modifications will appear on the final result.
